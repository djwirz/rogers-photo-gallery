# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Local Preprocessing (Deduplication-First)

### 1.1 Image Deduplication

- [ ] Set up Python environment with required dependencies
  - imagehash
  - Pillow
  - OpenCV (optional)
- [ ] Implement perceptual hashing algorithm
  - Test both pHash and aHash approaches
  - Determine optimal threshold for similarity
- [ ] Create deduplication script
  - Input: Source directory
  - Output: Clean directory + archive directory
  - Logging and reporting

### 1.2 File Organization

- [ ] Implement optional EXIF-based renaming
  - Fallback to hash-based naming
  - Preserve original names as metadata
- [ ] Create directory structure
  - photos-clean/
  - dedupe-archive/

## Phase 2: Cloud Infrastructure

### 2.1 Fly.io Setup

- [ ] Install and configure Fly.io CLI
- [ ] Create Fly.io application
- [ ] Set up persistent volume
- [ ] Configure networking and security

### 2.2 Photoview Deployment

- [ ] Clone and configure Photoview
- [ ] Set up Docker environment
- [ ] Configure volume mounts
- [ ] Deploy initial instance

## Phase 3: Data Migration & Validation

### 3.1 Upload Strategy

- [ ] Implement automated upload process
- [ ] Test with sample dataset
- [ ] Monitor transfer performance

### 3.2 Validation

- [ ] Verify deduplication results
- [ ] Check metadata preservation
- [ ] Test timeline view
- [ ] Validate sharing functionality

## Notes

- Each phase can be iterated on independently
- Testing should be performed at each step
- Performance metrics should be collected
