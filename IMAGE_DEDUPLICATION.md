# Image Deduplication Implementation Plan

## Overview

Simple script to identify and handle duplicate images before uploading to the photo gallery. This is a one-time task for processing a small batch of photos.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required packages:
  - Pillow (PIL) for image processing
  - imagehash for perceptual hashing

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Basic Setup

- [ ] Create a simple script structure:
  ```
  dedupe.py
  test_photos/
  ├── clean/      # Deduplicated photos
  └── archive/    # Duplicate photos
  ```

### 2. Core Functionality

- [ ] Implement basic image hashing using imagehash
- [ ] Create simple comparison function to identify duplicates
- [ ] Add basic file movement to separate duplicates

### 3. Testing

- [ ] Test with a small set of photos (5-10)
- [ ] Verify duplicates are correctly identified
- [ ] Check that files are moved to correct directories

### 4. Usage

- [ ] Document basic usage in script comments
- [ ] Add simple command-line arguments for:
  - Input directory
  - Output directories

## Success Criteria

- Successfully identify and separate duplicate photos
- Maintain original image quality
- Simple to run and understand
