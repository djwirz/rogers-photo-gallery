# Phase 3: Data Migration

## Current Status

- [ ] Initial testing with small photo batch
- [ ] Persistence verification
- [ ] Display quality validation
- [ ] Bulk upload implementation
- [ ] Metadata verification
- [ ] Timeline view testing

## Testing Strategy

1. Small Batch Testing

   - Select 5-10 photos for initial testing
   - Verify EXIF data before upload
   - Test upload process
   - Validate display and metadata
   - Document any issues

2. Persistence Testing

   - Verify data persistence after service restart
   - Check metadata retention
   - Validate timeline view consistency
   - Test navigation persistence

3. Display Testing
   - Verify thumbnail generation
   - Test full-screen view
   - Check zoom functionality
   - Validate loading performance
   - Test different photo formats

## Technical Constraints

1. Upload Process

   - Bulk upload capability
   - Progress tracking
   - Error handling
   - Resume capability

2. Metadata Preservation

   - Verify EXIF data
   - Check date accuracy
   - Validate image quality
   - Confirm file integrity

3. Timeline View
   - Test date-based organization
   - Verify sorting accuracy
   - Check display quality
   - Validate navigation

## Implementation Rules

- No data loss during upload
- Maintain upload logs
- Verify each batch
- Test with sample sets
- Document any issues

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 completion
- Phase 2 deployment
- Photoview configuration
- Storage setup complete

## Validation Steps

- Check deduplication results
- Verify gallery functionality
- Test sharing features
- Validate timeline view
- Confirm metadata display

## Next Steps

1. Select and verify test photo batch
2. Run initial upload test
3. Verify persistence
4. Test display functionality
5. Document findings
6. Proceed with bulk upload implementation
7. Scale testing with larger batches
