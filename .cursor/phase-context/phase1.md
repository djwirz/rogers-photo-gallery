# Phase 1: Local Preprocessing

## Current Status

- [x] Deduplication script setup and testing
- [x] Photo processing and verification
- [x] Output organization
- [x] EXIF-based renaming
- [x] Directory structure setup

## Technical Constraints

1. Deduplication

   - Must use perceptual hashing
   - Preserve original files
   - Log all duplicate pairs
   - Handle various image formats

2. File Organization

   - EXIF date extraction
   - Historical photo handling (1800s-1970s)
   - Scan date handling (skip 2009)
   - Multiple date source support

3. Directory Structure
   - `deduplicated_photos/` for clean files
   - `duplicate_photos/` for identified duplicates
   - Maintain original structure in archive

## Implementation Rules

- No destructive transformations
- Preserve all metadata
- Log all operations
- Maintain file integrity
- Support rollback capability

## Next Steps

- Verify deduplication results
- Test EXIF extraction
- Validate directory structure
- Prepare for Phase 2
