# Rogers Photo Gallery

A simple photo gallery solution for sharing family photos with extended family.

## Goals

## Project Structure

- `.cursor/` - Project context and constraints
  - `context.md` - Overall project context and rules
  - `constraints.json` - Technical constraints and phase boundaries
  - `phase-context/` - Phase-specific implementation details
- `deduplicated_photos/` - Processed photos ready for deployment
- `photos_to_process/` - Source photos
- `duplicate_photos/` - Identified duplicates
- Python scripts for processing
- Configuration files for deployment

## Development Workflow

This project uses a context-based development workflow to maintain focus and prevent scope creep. All development should:

1. Follow the current phase constraints in `.cursor/constraints.json`
2. Reference the appropriate phase context in `.cursor/phase-context/`
3. Maintain the project's core goals defined in `.cursor/context.md`
4. Document all changes according to the phase requirements

## Documentation

The project's implementation details and constraints are maintained in the `.cursor` directory:

- `.cursor/context.md` - Overall project context and rules
- `.cursor/constraints.json` - Technical constraints and phase boundaries
- `.cursor/phase-context/` - Phase-specific implementation details
  - `phase1.md` - Completed local preprocessing phase
  - `phase2.md` - Completed gallery setup phase
  - `phase3.md` - Current data migration phase

## Deduplication Results

The initial deduplication run processed 3,390 images and identified 14 pairs of duplicate photos. The duplicates were found between files with similar naming patterns, primarily between `Picture_XXX` and `Leonne_and_Chuck_XXX` series. This suggests these are likely the same photos with different naming conventions from different sources.

### Identified Duplicates

## Photoview Deployment

### Current Setup

- ‚úÖ Deployed on Fly.io with persistent storage
- ‚úÖ Basic authentication enabled
- ‚úÖ Timeline view configured
- ‚úÖ Metadata display enabled
- ‚úÖ Auto-scanning configured (hourly)

### Access Information

- URL: https://rogers-photo-gallery.fly.dev
- Admin credentials are stored securely in Fly.io configuration
- Photos are stored in the persistent volume at `/data`

### Deployment Strategy

1. Image-Based Deployment

   - Photos included in deployment image
   - No runtime file uploads
   - Read-only access to media
   - Automatic scanning on startup

2. Volume Usage

   - /data/photos: Read-only mount for media
   - /data/cache: Writable for thumbnails
   - /data/photoview.db: Database storage

3. File System Principles
   - Filesystem as source of truth
   - No post-deployment modifications
   - Original files never modified
   - Automatic scanning only

### Maintenance

- The application automatically scans for new photos hourly
- Storage automatically extends up to 5GB as needed
- Health checks ensure service availability
- Regular backups are maintained through the local photo collection

### Next Steps

1. Create deployment image with photos
2. Test sharing functionality with family members
3. Monitor usage and optimize performance
4. Document family member onboarding process
