## Project Structure

- `.cursor/` - Project context and constraints
  - `context.md` - Overall project context and rules
  - `constraints.json` - Technical constraints and phase boundaries
  - `phase-context/` - Phase-specific implementation details
- `deduplicated_photos/` - Processed photos for deployment
- `photos_to_process/` - Source photos
- `duplicate_photos/` - Identified duplicates
- `test_photos/` - Test photo sets
- Python scripts for processing
- Configuration files for deployment

## Development Workflow

This project uses a context-based development workflow to maintain focus and prevent scope creep. All development should:

1. Follow the current phase constraints in `.cursor/constraints.json`
2. Reference the appropriate phase context in `.cursor/phase-context/`
3. Maintain the project's core goals defined in `.cursor/context.md`
4. Document all changes according to the phase requirements

## Local Development

1. Set up Docker environment
2. Test directory structure
3. Verify EXIF data
4. Test with small batches
5. Document all changes

## Deployment Process

**Fly.io Single-Volume Constraint:**

- Fly.io only allows one persistent volume per machine.
- Both the photo library and the Photoview database must reside on the same volume.
- The correct structure is:
  - `/data/photos` (all media files)
  - `/data/photoview.db` (database file)
- Only a single volume (e.g., `photoview_db`) should be mounted at `/data`.
- Do NOT attempt to mount a second volume for `/photos` or any other path.
- All configuration, scripts, and documentation reflect this constraint.

1. Verify local testing
2. Deploy in small batches
3. Test each deployment
4. Document results

## Documentation

The project's implementation details and constraints are maintained in the `.cursor` directory:

- `.cursor/context.md` - Overall project context and rules
- `.cursor/constraints.json` - Technical constraints and phase boundaries
- `.cursor/phase-context/` - Phase-specific implementation details
  - `phase1.md` - Completed local preprocessing phase
  - `phase2.md` - Completed gallery setup phase
  - `phase3.md` - Current data migration phase

## Deduplication Results

The initial deduplication run processed 3,390 images and identified 14 pairs of duplicate photos. The duplicates were found between files with similar naming patterns, primarily between `Picture_XXX` and `Leonne_and_Chuck_XXX` series. This suggests these are likely the same photos with different naming conventions from different sources.

### Identified Duplicates

1. `Picture_093(rev 0).jpg` ↔ `Leonne_and_Chuck_093(rev 0).jpg`
2. `Picture_164(rev 0).jpg` ↔ `Leonne_and_Chuck_164(rev 0).jpg`
3. `Picture_955(rev 1).jpg` ↔ `Picture_952(rev 0).jpg`
4. `PD_0704(rev 1).jpg` ↔ `PD_0044-5(rev 0).jpg`
5. `Picture_691(rev 0).jpg` ↔ `Picture_951(rev 1).jpg`
6. `PD_0021-1(rev 1).jpg` ↔ `scandanavianinininini_166(rev 1).jpg`
7. `Picture_413(rev 0).jpg` ↔ `Leonne_and_Chuck_413(rev 0).jpg`
8. `scandanavianinininini_019-1(rev 0).jpg` ↔ `scandanavianinininini_019(rev 0).jpg`
9. `Picture_313(rev 0).jpg` ↔ `Leonne_and_Chuck_313(rev 0).jpg`
10. `Picture_110(rev 1).jpg` ↔ `Leonne_and_Chuck_110(rev 0).jpg`
11. `Picture_004(rev 1).jpg` ↔ `Leonne_and_Chuck_004(rev 0).jpg`
12. `Picture_180(rev 1).jpg` ↔ `Leonne_and_Chuck_180(rev 0).jpg`
13. `Picture_224(rev 1).jpg` ↔ `Leonne_and_Chuck_224(rev 0).jpg`
14. `Picture_001(rev 0).jpg` ↔ `Leonne_and_Chuck_001(rev 0).jpg`

## Photoview Deployment

2. Test directory structure
3. Verify EXIF data
4. Test with small batches
5. Document findings

## Implementation Plan

See [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md) for detailed implementation steps and progress tracking.

## Important Note: Dev vs Production Storage

- The local dev environment mounts ./Photos to /photos, which is NOT available in production.
- In production (Fly.io), you must manually upload or create /data/photos on the persistent volume.
- The main production challenge is getting images into /data/photos, not gallery UI or database setup.
- Use dev only for UI/database validation, not for storage or upload workflows.

### How to Upload Images to /data/photos on Fly.io

1. SSH into your Fly.io machine:
   ```sh
   flyctl ssh console -a rogers-photo-gallery
   mkdir -p /data/photos
   exit
   ```
2. Use SFTP to upload images:
   ```sh
   flyctl ssh sftp shell -a rogers-photo-gallery
   put -r /path/to/local/photos /data/photos
   exit
   ```
   (You can also use `scp` or other tools if you prefer.)
3. Once images are uploaded, add `/data/photos` as the library path in the Photoview UI.
4. Photoview will scan and index your images from `/data/photos`.
